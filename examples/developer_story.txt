Once upon a time, a software developer named Nate was struggling with a particularly difficult bug. 
After three days of non-stop work, Nate finally discovered the issue was just a missing semicolon. 
Frustrated but relieved, Nate went to grab coffee, only to spill it on the laptop. 
In a panic, Nate tried to save the code before the computer died, frantically hitting Ctrl+S repeatedly.
By some miracle, not only did the computer survive, but the coffee somehow fixed another bug 
that had been plaguing the project for weeks. When Nate's boss asked how they solved both problems so quickly, 
Nate just smiled and said, "It's all about having the right development environment."
The team laughed, but from then on, a cup of coffee always sat ready by Nate's deskâ€”just in case another bug needed fixing.
